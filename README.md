# Shallow Water Equation
 
 These files are Python code files created to explore the 1D shallow water equation. The files consist of the following three files:
 
 * Function.py
 
 * SWE.py
 
 * main.py
 
 Function.py is a library created to define functions used for differentiation and approximation, while SWE is a class that defines various functions needed for the experiments. Finally, main contains a collection of example code.
 
 Updates are planned for the future.
 
 
 ## Function.py
 
 Function.py includes interpolation and differential method which is used in SWE class. The belows are the contents summary.
 
 
 ## SWE.py
 
 SWE is the class for testing shallow water equation. You can make a new test set with this simple code: test=SWE().
